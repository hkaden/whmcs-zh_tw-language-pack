# WHMCS Chinese (Traditional) Language Pack 繁體中文語言包
###### This version based on [WHMCS-CN-translations](https://github.com/kaneawk/WHMCS-CN-translations "WHMCS-CN-translations") I translated to Traditional Chinese and fixed some 'weird' words

###### 此版本是基於 [WHMCS-CN-translations](https://github.com/kaneawk/WHMCS-CN-translations "WHMCS-CN-translations") 制作的，我將它翻譯為繁體中文並修正了一些「奇怪」的字

## Installation

### 1. Upload file

    1. Upload lang/chinese-zh.php to your whmcs_install_dir/lang/ path.

    if you current use WHMCS v6.3.0 or higher, you should rename original chinese.php to chinese-tw.php manually. Because original chinese.php was a Traditional Chinese edition.

    2. Upload admin/lang/chinese-zh.php to your whmcs_install_dir/admin/lang/ path.

### 2. Choose Chinese language and set it to default

    1. Sign out your admin account, then choose Chinese-zh language on login page.

    3. Goto "Setup > General Settings", click "Localisation" tab, set "Default Language" to Chinese, at last click "Save Changes" button.
